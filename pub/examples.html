    <h1> Recognizing Different Species of Mushrooms <span id=toDocs><a>API</a></span></h1>
    <div id='middleContainer'>
        This library is all about encapsulation. For this demonstration, the theme will be a webpage that's all about mushrooms. While this is quite sepecific, 
        I think the way it uses the library's functionalities is a good representation of the how the library will be used in general.
        <br>
        <h3>Basic Popup</h3>
        Psilocybe quebecensis is a moderately active mushroom in the section Aztecorum, having psilocybin and psilocin as active compounds.
        Hover over <span id=hover>me</span> to take a look at this not so extraordinary shroom.

        <br>
        <h3>Persisting Popups</h3>
        P.Quebecensis which is native to Quebec are not to be confused with the popular Liberty Caps found in the east coast.
        Click <span id=persistDrag1>this</span> to see a picture of P.Quebecensis and  <span id=persistDrag2>this</span> for a picture of a Liberty Cap, and 
        <span id=persistDrag3>this</span> for a similar but different species. We can compare the small differences
        between them by dragging them together. Click to drag and click again to drop. Pretty neat eh? Here's the <span id='persistCode'>code sample</span> which can also be moved. 
        
        <h3>Custom locations, resiability, and animatons</h3>
        You may have noticed that the previous mushrooms spawned at unusal places, this can be set using the <span id='shiftCode'>shift</span> parameter. For example,
        we can make this picture of <span id="topleft">Psilocybe quebecensis</span> appear at the top of the page near releveant information! We can also expand it by clicking that
        little button on the bottom right, moving the curosor, and clicking again to drop. We have also animated it to fade and float using the <span id='animateCode'>animate</span> method.

        <br>
        <h3>Multiple popups</h3>
        Hover over the mushroom stew to see multiple popups appear around it, useful for viewing its ingredients or just to see
        more mushrooms. <span id='multiCode'>Sample code</span> (resizable).
        <br><br>

        <div id=multiple >
            <img src='https://holycowvegan.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/hearty-vegan-mushroom-stew-9.jpg' />
        </div>

        <h3 class='squish'>Text popups</h3>
        <p>
            We can also create text popups where we get to specify the <span id=textBackground>background</span> and font. Developers can
            either make the text fit inside the box or have it so that users can <span id='resizeText'>resize</span> the text popup to read more.
            They can also have it so when a user <span id='expand'>clicks</span> an element and then hovers over its popup, it automatically expands to reveals more text.
            <span id='resizableCode'>Code sample</span>
        </p>
            <h3>Changing attributes later</h3>
            The developer is also able to change the functionalities of already created popups later. <span id=notDraggable>This</span> mushroom is
            not draggable. Clicking <span id='changeOther'>this</span> will now make it draggable! This is done though the <span id='setAbilCode'>.setAbilities</span> method.
        <br>
        <h3>Custumoizable elements</h3>
        Finally we can pass <span id='triggerText'>custom</span> html elements into our popups for even more customization. This example has popups that trigger
        more popups. <span id='customCode'>To do this</span> we pass in our own html element to .createPopup and for each button inside it, we call .createPopup on it.

        <div id='personalizedElement'>
            <div class='box-header'>Psilocybe atlantis</div>
            <ul class='box' id='info'><span class='box-item'>Information</span><span class='box-arrow'>&#11166;</span></ul>
            <ul class='box' id='pict'><span class='box-item'>Pictures</span><span class='box-arrow'>&#11166;</span></ul>
            <ul class='box' id='sour'><span class='box-item'>Sources</span><span class='box-arrow'>&#11166;</span></ul>
        </div>

        <h3>End</h3>
        The rest of the text is just lorem ipsum, feel free to ignore. <br/> 
        I was walking alongside the highway and started having some strange and scary thoughts like, "this is it, I'm so glad
        my life is finally over, freedom is coming soon!" And then I passed a cow field. And there was this one cow standing there by the
        fence, just staring at me. I continued to walk, and I watched the cow, and it just stood there, immobile, and it continued to
        stare, and stare, and stare. I completely forgot about myself and my problems and was overcome by the very powerful need to go and
        talk to this cow.

        So I went up and talked to the cow. And then other cows came, and I talked to them too. They seemed to really enjoy my presence, and
        before I knew it there were more than a dozen cows standing there mooing at me while I waved and sang and told them they were good
        cows and gushed over how much I loved them.
