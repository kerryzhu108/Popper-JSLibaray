    <h1> Recognizing Different Species of Mushrooms </h1>
    <div id='middleContainer'>
        The following text are just filler, library usage starts from the first bolded text. 
        There are over 200 species of Psilocybe mushrooms, each possessing visually unique characteristics along with varying
        levels and ratios of three psychotropic compounds â€” psilocybin, psilocin, and baeocystin. <br> <br>
        A few of the most prevalent species are P. azurescens, P. cyanescens, P. semilanceata, and P. cubensis (which is the most widely known and easily
        cultivated). There are also hundreds of "strains" or "subspecies" which have been genetically isolated and classified
        by both professional mycologists and recreational enthusiasts. <br><br>
        
        While taxonomically these strains are all considered members
        of their respective species (and most are P. cubensis), they too can differ drastically in appearance, conditions
        required for cultivation, and potency.

        <br><br>
        Hover over <span id=hover>me</span> to see a basic popup. Now click this <span id=persist>element</span> to see a picture
        that persists after hover. This can be closed by clicking the close box. When there are multiple pictures that persist, the developer
        can also enable dragging to allow users to carefully compare small <span id=persistDrag>differences</span> among different species of
        <span id=persistDrag2>mushrooms</span> Try clicking and dragging the two previous popups from the bolded words. Pretty neat eh? You may have noticed
        that the previous popups spawned at unusal places, this can be set using the shift parameter. For example,
        we can make this <span id="topleft">mushroom</span> appear at the top of the page! We can also expand it by clicking and dragging that
        little button on the bottom right.

        <br><br>
        We can also have this mushroom stew image spawn multiple mushrooms around it, useful for viewing its ingredients or just to see
        more mushrooms.

        </div>
        <p> 
            We can also create text popups where we get to specify the <span id=textBackground>background</span> and font. Developers can
            either make the text fit inside the box or have it so that users can <span id='resizeText'>resize</span> the text popup to read more.
            They can also have it so when a user <span id='expand'>clicks</span> an element and then hovers over its popup, it reveals more text.
            We can enable multiple elements to reveal the same <span id='samePopup'>popup</span>. The developer is also able to 
            change the functionalities of already created popups later. Clicking <span id='changeOther'>this</span> we have changed the second
            popup to now be draggable.

        <h3>Psilocybin-Containing Shroom Species</h3>
        The rest of the text is just lorpem ipsum. The differing Psilocybe species have a much longer and more intensive taxonomical history than the relatively recent distinctions
        among strains. The first reliable documented case of Psilocybe intoxication occurred in 1799, when a man picked several semilanceata 
        from the shores of the Thames River in London, and cooked a meal for his family with them. This surprise trip spurred the classification of 
        a new species of mushroom, which was placed in the genus Agaricus, then moved to Psilocybe in 1871. For the purpose of remaining succinct, 
        this article focuses on the four species most commonly found in North America.
